# Mesopotamian Social Simulation — START HERE

**Role:** Canonical project orientation map  
**Keep this file short. Do not turn it into a second specification.**

## Project

A historically grounded autonomous simulation of ancient Mesopotamian society, built from persistent individuals → relationships → households → larger formations. Higher layers may become persistent causal actors but must not erase the lower-level reality through which they exist.

## Authority

1. `founding/00_MESOPOTAMIA_SIMULATION_PROJECT_SEED.md`
2. Explicitly approved constitutional decisions
3. `governance/WORKING_CONSTITUTION.md`
4. Accepted decisions / ADRs
5. Accepted subsystem specifications
6. Implementation constrained by the above

Conversation, brainstorming, research returns, proposals, roadmaps, working notes, and existing code are not authoritative merely because they exist.

## Current phase

**ROADMAP STAGE 4 — SFL v0 REFERENCE PROTOTYPE IMPLEMENTATION**

Accepted foundation:

- `DEC-0001` — Foundational Social-Fabric Model
- `DEC-0002` — Master Architect Operating Guide
- `DEC-0009` — Layered Master Architect Rulebook Refactor
- `ADR-0001 / DEC-0003` — Active Social-State Representation
- `ADR-0002 / DEC-0004` — Hierarchical Individual Agency
- `DEC-0005` — Architecture Development Policy
- `ADR-0003 / DEC-0006` — Progressive Derived-State Specialization
- `ADR-0004 / DEC-0007` — Reference Simulation Kernel
- `ADR-0005 / DEC-0008` — C# 14 / .NET 10 LTS Host Runtime
- `SPEC-SFL-0001` — accepted Social Fabric Laboratory v0 semantics

- frozen failed conformance refs: `imp-0001-slice1-conformance-candidate-v1`, `imp-0001-slice1-conformance-candidate-v2`
- latest independent review: `research/technical/IMP-0001/IMP-0001_INDEPENDENT_CONFORMANCE_REVIEW_V2.md`
- TRES-0010 pre-implementation gate: **CLOSED / PASS**
- GOV-0001 rulebook restructuring: **PROMOTED / DEC-0009 ACCEPTED**
- after verified Slice-1 PASS/promotion: run `plans/SFL_V0_SLICE1_BIRTH_OBSERVATION_PLAN.md` before Slice 2.

## Repository discipline

This Git repository is the canonical working location. Git preserves history; current canonical artifacts remain current. Working design stays explicitly non-authoritative until promoted.
